# The Battle at HogWARts

> "We must try not to sink beneath our anguish, but battle on." ~Albus Dumbledore

War is a card game typically played between two people. The deck is split into two, and each turn consists of playing one card to the pot, and comparing their values.<br>
Winner is the player with the highest value card, and they add both cards to their personal deck.
<br>
In the case of a tie, three cards from each player are added to the pot, and the last played card by each player, is compared again to find the winner of the entire pot. <br>
Game continues until one player has all the cards in their personal deck, making them the winner.<br>
<br>
I grew up playing war as we sat and waited on our parents in various scenarios, so I have a lot of fond memories around it. Having a mobile game, without having to always have your deck of cards with you, would have been amazing! There are also a lot of Harry Potter fans in my circles, and so this seemed like the perfect combination of worlds.
